This project lets you ask questions about a PDF and get smart, helpful answers. It works by first reading the PDF and breaking it into chunks. Those chunks are turned into embeddings and stored using FAISS so we can quickly find the most relevant parts later. When you ask a question, the system finds the matching sections from the PDF and uses the LLaMA 2 language model (via Ollama) to generate an answer based only on that information. It's a simple way to chat with your documents
