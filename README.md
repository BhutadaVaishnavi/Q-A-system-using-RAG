This project lets you ask questions about a PDF and get smart, helpful answers. It works by first reading the PDF and breaking it into chunks. Those chunks are turned into embeddings and stored using FAISS so we can quickly find the most relevant parts later. When you ask a question, the system finds the matching sections from the PDF and uses the LLaMA 2 language model (via Ollama) to generate an answer based only on that information. It's a simple way to chat with your documents
This is my **HotelBot India/ StayQuery** project helps you find the right hotels in India just by asking questions in everyday language. It uses a PDF file that contains detailed information about different hotels—like where they are, what facilities they offer, and more. You can ask things like “Can you recommend hotels in Goa with a swimming pool?” or “Which hotels offer free Wi-Fi and breakfast?” Behind the scenes, the system searches the PDF for the most relevant details and uses the LLaMA 2 model (via Ollama) to give you a clear, helpful answer. It’s a simple way to explore hotel options based on your needs—without having to scroll through tons of listings.
